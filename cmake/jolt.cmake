# When turning this option on, the library will be compiled using doubles for positions. This allows for much bigger worlds.
set(DOUBLE_PRECISION OFF)

# When turning this option on, the library will be compiled with debug symbols
set(GENERATE_DEBUG_SYMBOLS ON)

# When turning this option on, the library will be compiled in such a way to attempt to keep the simulation deterministic across platforms
set(CROSS_PLATFORM_DETERMINISTIC OFF)

# When turning this option on, the library will be compiled with interprocedural optimizations enabled, also known as link-time optimizations or link-time code generation.
# Note that if you turn this on you need to use SET_INTERPROCEDURAL_OPTIMIZATION() or set(CMAKE_INTERPROCEDURAL_OPTIMIZATION ON) to enable LTO specificly for your own project as well.
# If you don't do this you may get an error: /usr/bin/ld: libJolt.a: error adding symbols: file format not recognized
#set(INTERPROCEDURAL_OPTIMIZATION ON)

# When turning this on, in Debug and Release mode, the library will emit extra code to ensure that the 4th component of a 3-vector is kept the same as the 3rd component 
# and will enable floating point exceptions during simulation to detect divisions by zero. 
# Note that this currently only works using MSVC. Clang turns Float2 into a SIMD vector sometimes causing floating point exceptions (the option is ignored).
set(FLOATING_POINT_EXCEPTIONS_ENABLED OFF)

# Number of bits to use in ObjectLayer. Can be 16 or 32.
set(OBJECT_LAYER_BITS 32)

# Select X86 processor features to use, by default the library compiles with AVX2, if everything is off it will be SSE2 compatible.
